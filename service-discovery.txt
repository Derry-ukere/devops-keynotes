service doscovery arises when resources or services need to talk to each other
eg database and server

u"ll need servic discvery if
u need zero downtime
runng a couple of micro services
deploying to serveral enviroments eg dev/staging/ephemeral/production



the idea for downtime deployment
start a new version and wait until they are up
divert the trafic to it and close old version


#another aproach is to store ips on a hashtable

#APPLICATION PERFOMANCE management
logg agrgations : collects loggs from all microservice into a dashboard that can be search

metrics aggregation is important for debugging

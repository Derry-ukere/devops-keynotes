DevOps is a set of practices that combines 
software development and IT operations. 



#what can be automates?
ci
security scanning

#application performance management;
metrics: numeric measure of key numbers in production
logging : text descriotion of what is happening in the sofware
monitoring : takes logs and metrics and convert them to healt metrics
alerting :

#TDD
unit test : test individual component work

system test : test the whole system
acceptance test

#what is code coverage
code coverage is use to represent the 
number of files and the tests that are been run in that file

type of line in a codebase
synthetic line
logic line with side effect
branch lines

code coverage = ratio of line of code with test (none syntax line) / lines of code(none syntax line)

#when to care about test coverage
when the platform has users 
working with developers that arent immediately trust worth
working on a large code base with a lot of testable components


rules of code coverage
code coverage must note reduce
code owners must test files


code coverage measurement tools
codecov
coveralls
code climate


#linting best practices
linters make sure that obvious bug do not make it to production

a team of more than one developers should set up linting


#ephemeral enviroment
this is a temporay deployment enviroment that have a self contained version of the application
generally every feature branch


#how to ephemeral database work
they are pre populated
undoable or easy to represent
proper database migration


#xcersie
